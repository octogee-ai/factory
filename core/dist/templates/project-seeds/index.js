${projectName} starts on the **${recipe}** recipe.
${doctrine.recipeFit[recipe]}

The recipe is not permanent. Ask your agent to change it — your agent updates
the recipe on the project's platform record, and Preview and Publish both
follow it from then on.

## The first slice we ship

${doctrine.firstSlice}

## The craft

${doctrine.craft}

## The basics

- Small steps that ship. One visible change at a time, finished before the next.
- Show, do not summarize. A link someone can click beats a status update.
- Keep the project playbook about how ${projectName} works. Use the workspace
  Platform Playbook for Octogee platform behavior and limits.
- When something should stick, write it here or in the decisions log.
  Conversations evaporate. The repo does not.

## When this project earns real app services

${doctrine.appServicesTrigger}

Until then, start with local or mock data — a hard-coded list, the browser's
own storage, a file committed to this repo. That is not a shortcut. It is how
you find out whether this ever needs accounts at all.

When the trigger is real, ask your agent for an application-services plan. The
answer should be the smallest Firebase path that does the job — usually
sign-in plus a small database with its access rules written down. Never
Octogee's own platform database. And it lands in the decisions log before
anything gets wired.

## This project's defaults — edit these

- **Who it's for:** _fill in the customer_
- **The smallest real thing we ship first:** _fill it in_
- **Our proof link:** _the URL someone can open_
- **Our rhythm:** _evenings? weekends? sprints? whatever's true_
