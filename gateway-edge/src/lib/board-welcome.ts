**How it works**

- Every card is a real issue in your project's repo. Your Agent sees and manages them too.
- Drag cards between columns as work moves: **Backlog → To do → Doing → Review → Done**.
- Moving a card to **Done** closes it; Pulse counts it as shipped that week.
- Tap a card to open it — edit the description, add labels, comments, and screenshots.
- Label something **bug** and Pulse tracks it in your bug backlog until it's fixed.

**Let your Agent drive**

Ask in chat: "add a card for …", "move the login card to Done", "what's on the board?" — your Agent keeps the Board honest while you build.

When you've had a look around, drag this card to **Done**. That's your first ship. 🚀

// Seeded during project provisioning so a new Builder never opens an empty
