/**
 * publish-gateway-token.mjs — push the gateway's freshly generated auth
 * token into GCP Secret Manager so chat-proxy can authenticate upstream
 * WS connections without ever seeing the token on disk.
 *
 * Called once per gateway pod boot from entrypoint.sh AFTER the token
 * is generated and exported as OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN. chat-proxy fetches
 * the latest version of the same secret when it opens an upstream.
 *
 * Secret name: `gateway-auth-token-{gatewayId}` (e.g. `gateway-auth-token-gw-test`).
 * One secret per gateway-id keeps future multi-pod fleets cleanly scoped
 * (each pod rotates its own secret; chat-proxy resolves the right secret
 * from the user's assigned gatewayId in Firestore).
 *
 * Stays tight: logs to stderr only (stdout reserved for future JSON-RPC
 * callers).
 *
 * Exit codes (entrypoint.sh keys off these):
 *   0   — published successfully
 *   2   — setup-incomplete: secret missing, permission denied, or similar
 *         misconfigured-deploy failure. entrypoint.sh treats this as FATAL
 *         and crash-loops the pod so the operator fixes setup-secrets.sh
 *         before any traffic hits a broken gateway.
 *   1   — transient SM error (UNAVAILABLE, rate-limit, DNS blip). entrypoint
 *         treats this as WARN-and-continue; the pod still boots for ops
 *         traffic, and the next boot republishes.
 *
 * Required env:
 *   OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN  — the token value to publish
 *   GCP_PROJECT_ID          — GCP project owning the Secret Manager secret
 *   GATEWAY_ID              — gateway identifier, feeds the secret name
 *
 * Optional:
 *   GATEWAY_TOKEN_KEEP_VERSIONS — how many prior versions to retain. Floor 2.
